    "### Background and Context\n",
    "This section gives the reader the background knowledge they need to understand the problem. It explains key concepts, definitions, and any theory that the problem builds upon. The goal is to set the scene so that someone unfamiliar with the topic can follow along.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example: A Boolean function takes one or more True/False inputs and returns a single True/False output. In the Deutsch–Jozsa algorithm, functions are either constant (always return the same value) or balanced (return True for exactly half of the inputs).**\n",

    "**Example: Create a Python function called `random_constant_balanced` that returns a randomly chosen constant or balanced Boolean function with four inputs.**\n",

    "This section explains how I plan to solve the problem and why I chose this approach. It outlines my thought process, the steps I will take, and any decisions I made along the way. This helps the reader understand my logic before seeing the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example: I will first decide randomly whether to generate a constant or balanced function. For a constant function, I will randomly pick True or False as the output. For a balanced function, I will select exactly half of the 16 possible inputs to return True.**\n",

    "This section contains written test cases to verify that my implementation produces the correct outputs. I will test edge cases and typical inputs to ensure the code works as expected.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example: Test that a constant function returns the same value for all 16 possible inputs. Test that a balanced function returns True for exactly 8 inputs and False for the other 8.**\n",

    "### Efficiency or Limitations\n",
    "This section discusses the efficiency of my solution and any limitations it may have. I will consider time complexity, edge cases, or scenarios where the solution might not perform well.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example: My solution has O(n) time complexity where n is the number of possible inputs. A limitation is that it only works for functions with exactly four Boolean inputs.**\n",

    "### Problem 1: Generating Random Boolean Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question:** The [Deutsch–Jozsa algorithm](https://quantum.cloud.ibm.com/learning/en/modules/computer-science/deutsch-jozsa) is designed to work with functions that accept a fixed number of [Boolean inputs](https://realpython.com/python-boolean/) and return a single [Boolean output](https://realpython.com/python-boolean/). Each function is guaranteed to be either constant (always returns ``False`` or always returns ``True``) or balanced (returns ``True`` for exactly half of the possible input combinations). Write a Python function ``random_constant_balanced`` that returns a randomly chosen function from the set of constant or balanced functions taking four Boolean arguments as inputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Problem 2: Classical Testing for Function Type\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question:** [Deutsch's algorithm](https://quantum.cloud.ibm.com/learning/en/courses/fundamentals-of-quantum-algorithms/quantum-query-algorithms/deutsch-algorithm) is designed to demonstrate a [potential advantage of quantum computing](https://www.quantamagazine.org/john-preskill-explains-quantum-supremacy-20191002/) over classical computation. To understand this advantage, we must first understand the classical cost of solving the underlying problem. Write a Python function ``determine_constant_balanced`` that takes as input a function ``f``, as defined in Problem 1. The function should analyze ``f`` and return the string ``\"constant\"`` or ``\"balanced\"`` depending on whether the function is constant or balanced. Write a brief note on the efficiency of your solution. What is the maximum number of times you need to call ``f`` to be 100% certain whether it is constant or balanced?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Problem 3: Quantum Oracles\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question:** [Deutsch's algorithm](https://quantum.cloud.ibm.com/learning/en/courses/fundamentals-of-quantum-algorithms/quantum-query-algorithms/deutsch-algorithm) is the simplest example of a [quantum algorithm](https://www.ibm.com/quantum/blog/group-theory) using [superposition](https://scienceexchange.caltech.edu/topics/quantum-science-explained/quantum-superposition) to determine a [global property](https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2008/entries/qt-entangle/#5) of a function with a single evaluation. In the single-input case, there are four possible Boolean functions. Using Qiskit, create the appropriate [quantum oracles](https://quantumcomputing.stackexchange.com/questions/4625/what-exactly-is-an-oracle/4626#4626) for each of the possible single-Boolean-input functions used in Deutsch's algorithm. Demonstrate their use and explain how each oracle implements its corresponding function.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Problem 4: Deutsch's Algorithm with Qiskit\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question:** Use [Qiskit](https://www.ibm.com/quantum/qiskit) to design a [quantum circuit](https://quantum.cloud.ibm.com/learning/en/courses/basics-of-quantum-information/quantum-circuits/introduction) that solves Deutsch's problem for a function with a single Boolean input. Implement the necessary circuit and demonstrate its use with each of the quantum oracles from Problem 3. Describe how the interference pattern produced by the circuit allows you to determine whether the function is constant or balanced using only one query to the oracle.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Problem 5: Scaling to the Deutsch–Jozsa Algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question:** The [Deutsch–Jozsa algorithm](https://quantum.cloud.ibm.com/learning/en/modules/computer-science/deutsch-jozsa) generalizes Deutsch's approach to functions with several input bits. Use [Qiskit](https://www.ibm.com/quantum/qiskit) to create a quantum circuit that can handle the four-bit functions generated in Problem 1. Explain how the classical function is encoded as a quantum oracle, and demonstrate the use of your circuit on both of the constant functions and any two balanced functions of your choosing. Show that the circuit correctly identifies the type of each function."
