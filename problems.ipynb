    "### Background and Context\n",
    "This section gives the reader the background knowledge they need to understand the problem. It explains key concepts, definitions, and any theory that the problem builds upon. The goal is to set the scene so that someone unfamiliar with the topic can follow along.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Example: A Boolean function takes one or more True/False inputs and returns a single True/False output. In the Deutsch–Jozsa algorithm, functions are either constant (always return the same value) or balanced (return True for exactly half of the inputs).*\n",

    "### Problem Statement\n",
    "This section clearly states what the problem is asking me to do. It is a brief summary of the task taken from the assessment instructions. I restate it in my own words to show I understand what is required.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Example: Create a Python function called `random_constant_balanced` that returns a randomly chosen constant or balanced Boolean function with four inputs.*\n",

    "\n",
    "### Approach and Reasoning\n",
    "This section explains how I plan to solve the problem and why I chose this approach. It outlines my thought process, the steps I will take, and any decisions I made along the way. This helps the reader understand my logic before seeing the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Example: I will first decide randomly whether to generate a constant or balanced function. For a constant function, I will randomly pick True or False as the output. For a balanced function, I will select exactly half of the 16 possible inputs to return True.*\n",
