These functions form the foundation of digital logic and computer circuits. For example, a simple Boolean function with one input might always return ``True``, or it might flip the input (returning ``False`` when given ``True``, and vice versa).\n",

    "### Approach & Reasoning\n",
    "\n",
    "The task requires creating a Python function that randomly generates either a constant or balanced Boolean function with four inputs. To solve this problem, I need to understand what data structure can represent such a function and how to ensure the randomness meets the mathematical requirements.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, I will represent the Boolean function as a lookup table. Since there are four Boolean inputs, there are 2⁴ = 16 possible input combinations. Each combination can be represented as a tuple of four Boolean values, such as ``(True, False, True, False)``. The function will map each of these 16 tuples to either ``True`` or ``False``. I will use a [Python dictionary](https://realpython.com/python-dicts/) to store these mappings, where the keys are tuples representing input combinations and the values are the corresponding outputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, I need to randomly decide whether to generate a constant or balanced function. I will use Python's [``random`` module](https://docs.python.org/3/library/random.html) to make this choice with equal probability. The ``random.choice()`` function provides a simple way to randomly select between these two options.\n",
    "\n",
    "For generating a constant function, the logic is straightforward. I will randomly select either ``True`` or ``False`` using ``random.choice([True, False])``, then assign this same value to all 16 possible input combinations. This ensures the function always returns the same output regardless of the input, satisfying the definition of a constant function.\n",
    "\n",
    "For generating a balanced function, I need to ensure exactly 8 of the 16 inputs return ``True`` and the other 8 return ``False``. To achieve this, I will first generate all 16 possible input combinations using [``itertools.product()``](https://docs.python.org/3/library/itertools.html#itertools.product), which efficiently creates the [Cartesian product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartesian_product) of Boolean values. Then, I will use ``random.sample()`` to randomly select exactly 8 of these combinations without replacement. These selected combinations will be assigned ``True``, while the remaining 8 will be assigned ``False``. This approach guarantees the balanced property while maintaining randomness in which specific inputs return which values.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, my function will return a Python function (using a [lambda or def statement](https://realpython.com/python-lambda/)) that takes four Boolean arguments and looks up the result in the dictionary. This creates a callable function object that can be tested and used in subsequent problems."

    "\n",
    "This implementation demonstrates the core ideas behind the [Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rspa.1992.0167) by building the classical functions that quantum computers can analyze more efficiently. Working through this problem reveals several key insights about Boolean functions and why quantum computing offers genuine advantages.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Boolean Function Universe**: When dealing with four Boolean inputs, we're exploring a space containing 2^16 = 65,536 different possible Boolean functions. The Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm, however, only cares about a small fraction of these: exactly 2 constant functions plus C(16,8) = 12,870 balanced functions. This represents less than 20% of all possible functions, which shows us that the algorithm addresses a very specific mathematical problem rather than analyzing arbitrary functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "This restriction connects to broader work in [computational complexity theory](https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262533379/). As [Sipser (2012)](https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262018302/) explains in his foundational text on computation theory, many important algorithms work by restricting the problem space to make solutions tractable. The Deutsch-Jozsa approach exemplifies this principle by focusing on function classes with special mathematical properties.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Randomness in Algorithm Testing**: Using Python's `random` module ensures we generate constant and balanced functions with equal probability. This uniform distribution matters for fair algorithm testing since biased samples could make one algorithm appear better than another. The [pseudorandom generation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/random.html) works fine for our demonstration, though [Knuth (1997)](https://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~knuth/taocp.html) notes in *The Art of Computer Programming* that true randomness would require quantum or hardware sources for formal analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Storage Trade-offs**: Representing Boolean functions as lookup tables gives us instant O(1) access time but costs us O(2^n) storage space. With four inputs, storing 16 key-value pairs feels manageable, but this approach quickly breaks down. [Savage (1998)](https://www.elsevier.com/books/models-of-computation/savage/978-0-12-619851-0) discusses these exponential blowups in his models of computation text, showing why classical storage of Boolean functions becomes impossible as input size grows.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Classical Verification Costs**: Our test functions check all possible inputs to verify whether a function is constant or balanced. This exhaustive approach guarantees correctness but shows exactly why classical computation struggles here. As [Nielsen & Chuang (2010)](https://www.cambridge.org/highereducation/books/quantum-computation-and-quantum-information/01E10196D0A682A6802309D06B22D27D) demonstrate in their quantum computing textbook, verifying balanced functions classically requires evaluating up to half the inputs plus one more in the worst case.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Quantum Speedup Context**: This classical implementation helps us understand why the [quantum version](https://quantum.country/qcvc) provides such dramatic improvement. Classical computers need up to 2^(n-1) + 1 function calls to distinguish constant from balanced functions (9 calls for 4 inputs), but quantum computers need just one oracle call regardless of input size. [Bernstein & Vazirani (1997)](https://epubs.siam.org/doi/10.1137/S0097539796300921) showed that this exponential separation between classical and quantum query complexity extends to many similar problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Function Objects and Abstraction**: The returned function object bundles lookup behavior with metadata about function type. This design pattern shows how Python's support for functions as first-class objects enables clean abstractions. [Abelson & Sussman (1996)](https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262510875/) explore these abstraction techniques extensively in *Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs*, showing how treating functions as data enables powerful programming techniques.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Mathematical Foundations**: The code directly implements the formal definitions from Boolean algebra. Constant functions satisfy f(x₁,x₂,x₃,x₄) = c for some fixed constant c, while balanced functions satisfy |{x: f(x) = True}| = 2^(n-1). These definitions come from [discrete mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boolean_function) and connect to [Rosen's (2019)](https://www.mheducation.com/highered/product/discrete-mathematics-applications-rosen/M9781259676512.html) treatment of Boolean functions in his discrete math textbook.\n",
    "\n",
    "This problem bridges abstract mathematical concepts with practical quantum algorithm development. It shows how classical computational limits drive the search for quantum solutions, connecting to the broader narrative of quantum computing research described by [Preskill (2018)](https://quantum-journal.org/papers/q-2018-08-06-79/) in his analysis of quantum computing in the current era."

    "\n",
    "1. **Fixed Input Size**: The code only handles exactly four Boolean inputs. Making it work for any number of inputs would require rewriting the function signature and internal logic.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Memory Hungry**: The lookup table trades space for speed. For bigger problems, [implicit function representation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boolean_function#Representation) or [algebraic normal form](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_normal_form) would work better.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Pseudorandom Only**: We rely on Python's `random` module, which uses the [Mersenne Twister](https://docs.python.org/3/library/random.html#random.seed) algorithm.

    "**Classical vs Quantum Comparison**\n",
    "While generating these functions runs efficiently, figuring out whether an unknown function is constant or balanced classically requires up to 2^(n-1) + 1 function calls. For four inputs, this means up to 9 calls versus the quantum algorithm's single call. That's a 9x speedup. For larger inputs, this gap becomes exponentially huge.\n",

    "2. Using [lazy evaluation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lazy_evaluation) to avoid storing the full lookup table\n",
    "3. Implementing [streaming algorithms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_algorithm) when memory gets tight\n",
    "\n",
    "Our current approach prioritizes clarity and correctness over maximum speed. This makes it perfect for educational purposes and small quantum algorithm demos, while clearly showing the computational challenges that motivate quantum computing research."

    "**Question:** [Deutsch's algorithm](https://quantum.cloud.ibm.com/learning/en/courses/fundamentals-of-quantum-algorithms/quantum-query-algorithms/deutsch-algorithm) is designed to demonstrate a [potential advantage of quantum computing](https://www.quantamagazine.org/john-preskill-explains-quantum-supremacy-20191002/) over classical computation. To understand this advantage, we must first understand the classical cost of solving the underlying problem. Write a Python function ``determine_constant_balanced`` that takes as input a function ``f``, as defined in Problem 1. The function should analyze ``f`` and return the string ``\"constant\"`` or ``\"balanced\"`` depending on whether the function is constant or balanced. Write a brief note on the efficiency of your solution. What is the maximum number of times you need to call ``f`` to be 100% certain whether it is constant or balanced?"
