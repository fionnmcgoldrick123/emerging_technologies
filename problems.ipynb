    "\n",
    "**Question:** The [Deutsch–Jozsa algorithm](https://quantum.cloud.ibm.com/learning/en/modules/computer-science/deutsch-jozsa) is designed to work with functions that accept a fixed number of [Boolean inputs](https://realpython.com/python-boolean/) and return a single [Boolean output](https://realpython.com/python-boolean/). Each function is guaranteed to be either constant (always returns ``False`` or always returns ``True``) or balanced (returns ``True`` for exactly half of the possible input combinations). Write a Python function ``random_constant_balanced`` that returns a randomly chosen function from the set of constant or balanced functions taking four Boolean arguments as inputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Background & Context\n",
    "\n",
    "A [Boolean function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boolean_function) is a mathematical function that takes one or more ``True``/``False`` (or 1/0) inputs and returns a single ``True``/``False`` output. These functions form the foundation of digital logic and computer circuits. For example, a simple Boolean function with one input might always return ``True``, or it might flip the input (returning ``False`` when given ``True``, and vice versa).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example of Boolean Function:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Example: A simple Boolean function that flips its input\n",
    "def not_function(x):\n",
    "    return not x\n",
    "\n",
    "# Example usage\n",
    "print(not_function(True))   # Output: False\n",
    "print(not_function(False))  # Output: True\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "When we have multiple Boolean inputs, the number of possible input combinations grows exponentially. With four Boolean inputs, there are 2⁴ = 16 possible combinations (from 0000 to 1111 in binary). A Boolean function with four inputs must define what output it returns for each of these 16 possible inputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the context of the [Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deutsch%E2%80%93Jozsa_algorithm), which was introduced by [David Deutsch and Richard Jozsa in 1992](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rspa.1992.0167), we focus on two specific types of Boolean functions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Constant functions**: These always return the same value regardless of the input. For four inputs, there are only two constant functions, one that always returns ``True``, and one that always returns ``False``.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Balanced functions**: These return ``True`` for exactly half of the possible inputs and ``False`` for the other half. For four inputs, a balanced function returns ``True`` for exactly 8 of the 16 possible input combinations.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm was one of the first examples demonstrating that [quantum computers could solve certain problems more efficiently](https://quantum.country/qcvc) than classical computers. While the problem itself may seem artificial, it helped establish that quantum advantage is possible and paved the way for more practical quantum algorithms like [Shor's algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shor%27s_algorithm) for factoring large numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding how to generate and work with these constant and balanced functions classically is essential before we can appreciate the quantum speedup that the Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm provides.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Approach & Reasoning\n",
    "\n",
    "The task requires creating a Python function that randomly generates either a constant or balanced Boolean function with four inputs. To solve this problem, I need to understand what data structure can represent such a function and how to ensure the randomness meets the mathematical requirements.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, I will represent the Boolean function as a lookup table. Since there are four Boolean inputs, there are 2⁴ = 16 possible input combinations. Each combination can be represented as a tuple of four Boolean values, such as ``(True, False, True, False)``. The function will map each of these 16 tuples to either ``True`` or ``False``. I will use a [Python dictionary](https://realpython.com/python-dicts/) to store these mappings, where the keys are tuples representing input combinations and the values are the corresponding outputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, I need to randomly decide whether to generate a constant or balanced function. I will use Python's [``random`` module](https://docs.python.org/3/library/random.html) to make this choice with equal probability. The ``random.choice()`` function provides a simple way to randomly select between these two options.\n",
    "\n",
    "For generating a constant function, the logic is straightforward. I will randomly select either ``True`` or ``False`` using ``random.choice([True, False])``, then assign this same value to all 16 possible input combinations. This ensures the function always returns the same output regardless of the input, satisfying the definition of a constant function.\n",
    "\n",
    "For generating a balanced function, I need to ensure exactly 8 of the 16 inputs return ``True`` and the other 8 return ``False``. To achieve this, I will first generate all 16 possible input combinations using [``itertools.product()``](https://docs.python.org/3/library/itertools.html#itertools.product), which efficiently creates the [Cartesian product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartesian_product) of Boolean values. Then, I will use ``random.sample()`` to randomly select exactly 8 of these combinations without replacement. These selected combinations will be assigned ``True``, while the remaining 8 will be assigned ``False``. This approach guarantees the balanced property while maintaining randomness in which specific inputs return which values.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, my function will return a Python function (using a [lambda or def statement](https://realpython.com/python-lambda/)) that takes four Boolean arguments and looks up the result in the dictionary. This creates a callable function object that can be tested and used in subsequent problems.\n",

    "### Problem 2: Classical Testing for Function Type\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question:** [Deutsch's algorithm](https://quantum.cloud.ibm.com/learning/en/courses/fundamentals-of-quantum-algorithms/quantum-query-algorithms/deutsch-algorithm) is designed to demonstrate a [potential advantage of quantum computing](https://www.quantamagazine.org/john-preskill-explains-quantum-supremacy-20191002/) over classical computation. To understand this advantage, we must first understand the classical cost of solving the underlying problem. Write a Python function ``determine_constant_balanced`` that takes as input a function ``f``, as defined in Problem 1. The function should analyze ``f`` and return the string ``\"constant\"`` or ``\"balanced\"`` depending on whether the function is constant or balanced. Write a brief note on the efficiency of your solution. What is the maximum number of times you need to call ``f`` to be 100% certain whether it is constant or balanced?\n",

    "### Problem 3: Quantum Oracles\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question:** [Deutsch's algorithm](https://quantum.cloud.ibm.com/learning/en/courses/fundamentals-of-quantum-algorithms/quantum-query-algorithms/deutsch-algorithm) is the simplest example of a [quantum algorithm](https://www.ibm.com/quantum/blog/group-theory) using [superposition](https://scienceexchange.caltech.edu/topics/quantum-science-explained/quantum-superposition) to determine a [global property](https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2008/entries/qt-entangle/#5) of a function with a single evaluation. In the single-input case, there are four possible Boolean functions. Using Qiskit, create the appropriate [quantum oracles](https://quantumcomputing.stackexchange.com/questions/4625/what-exactly-is-an-oracle/4626#4626) for each of the possible single-Boolean-input functions used in Deutsch's algorithm. Demonstrate their use and explain how each oracle implements its corresponding function.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Problem 4: Deutsch's Algorithm with Qiskit\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question:** Use [Qiskit](https://www.ibm.com/quantum/qiskit) to design a [quantum circuit](https://quantum.cloud.ibm.com/learning/en/courses/basics-of-quantum-information/quantum-circuits/introduction) that solves Deutsch's problem for a function with a single Boolean input. Implement the necessary circuit and demonstrate its use with each of the quantum oracles from Problem 3. Describe how the interference pattern produced by the circuit allows you to determine whether the function is constant or balanced using only one query to the oracle.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Problem 5: Scaling to the Deutsch–Jozsa Algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question:** The [Deutsch–Jozsa algorithm](https://quantum.cloud.ibm.com/learning/en/modules/computer-science/deutsch-jozsa) generalizes Deutsch's approach to functions with several input bits. Use [Qiskit](https://www.ibm.com/quantum/qiskit) to create a quantum circuit that can handle the four-bit functions generated in Problem 1. Explain how the classical function is encoded as a quantum oracle, and demonstrate the use of your circuit on both of the constant functions and any two balanced functions of your choosing. Show that the circuit correctly identifies the type of each function."
