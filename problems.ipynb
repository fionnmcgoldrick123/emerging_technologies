These functions form the foundation of digital logic and computer circuits. For example, a simple Boolean function with one input might always return ``True``, or it might flip the input (returning ``False`` when given ``True``, and vice versa).\n",

    "### Approach & Reasoning\n",
    "\n",
    "The task requires creating a Python function that randomly generates either a constant or balanced Boolean function with four inputs. To solve this problem, I need to understand what data structure can represent such a function and how to ensure the randomness meets the mathematical requirements.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, I will represent the Boolean function as a lookup table. Since there are four Boolean inputs, there are 2⁴ = 16 possible input combinations. Each combination can be represented as a tuple of four Boolean values, such as ``(True, False, True, False)``. The function will map each of these 16 tuples to either ``True`` or ``False``. I will use a [Python dictionary](https://realpython.com/python-dicts/) to store these mappings, where the keys are tuples representing input combinations and the values are the corresponding outputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, I need to randomly decide whether to generate a constant or balanced function. I will use Python's [``random`` module](https://docs.python.org/3/library/random.html) to make this choice with equal probability. The ``random.choice()`` function provides a simple way to randomly select between these two options.\n",
    "\n",
    "For generating a constant function, the logic is straightforward. I will randomly select either ``True`` or ``False`` using ``random.choice([True, False])``, then assign this same value to all 16 possible input combinations. This ensures the function always returns the same output regardless of the input, satisfying the definition of a constant function.\n",
    "\n",
    "For generating a balanced function, I need to ensure exactly 8 of the 16 inputs return ``True`` and the other 8 return ``False``. To achieve this, I will first generate all 16 possible input combinations using [``itertools.product()``](https://docs.python.org/3/library/itertools.html#itertools.product), which efficiently creates the [Cartesian product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartesian_product) of Boolean values. Then, I will use ``random.sample()`` to randomly select exactly 8 of these combinations without replacement. These selected combinations will be assigned ``True``, while the remaining 8 will be assigned ``False``. This approach guarantees the balanced property while maintaining randomness in which specific inputs return which values.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, my function will return a Python function (using a [lambda or def statement](https://realpython.com/python-lambda/)) that takes four Boolean arguments and looks up the result in the dictionary. This creates a callable function object that can be tested and used in subsequent problems."

    "\n",
    "This implementation demonstrates the core ideas behind the [Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rspa.1992.0167) by building the classical functions that quantum computers can analyze more efficiently. Working through this problem reveals several key insights about Boolean functions and why quantum computing offers genuine advantages.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Boolean Function Universe**: When dealing with four Boolean inputs, we're exploring a space containing 2^16 = 65,536 different possible Boolean functions. The Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm, however, only cares about a small fraction of these: exactly 2 constant functions plus C(16,8) = 12,870 balanced functions. This represents less than 20% of all possible functions, which shows us that the algorithm addresses a very specific mathematical problem rather than analyzing arbitrary functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "This restriction connects to broader work in [computational complexity theory](https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262533379/). As [Sipser (2012)](https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262018302/) explains in his foundational text on computation theory, many important algorithms work by restricting the problem space to make solutions tractable. The Deutsch-Jozsa approach exemplifies this principle by focusing on function classes with special mathematical properties.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Randomness in Algorithm Testing**: Using Python's `random` module ensures we generate constant and balanced functions with equal probability. This uniform distribution matters for fair algorithm testing since biased samples could make one algorithm appear better than another. The [pseudorandom generation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/random.html) works fine for our demonstration, though [Knuth (1997)](https://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~knuth/taocp.html) notes in *The Art of Computer Programming* that true randomness would require quantum or hardware sources for formal analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Storage Trade-offs**: Representing Boolean functions as lookup tables gives us instant O(1) access time but costs us O(2^n) storage space. With four inputs, storing 16 key-value pairs feels manageable, but this approach quickly breaks down. [Savage (1998)](https://www.elsevier.com/books/models-of-computation/savage/978-0-12-619851-0) discusses these exponential blowups in his models of computation text, showing why classical storage of Boolean functions becomes impossible as input size grows.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Classical Verification Costs**: Our test functions check all possible inputs to verify whether a function is constant or balanced. This exhaustive approach guarantees correctness but shows exactly why classical computation struggles here. As [Nielsen & Chuang (2010)](https://www.cambridge.org/highereducation/books/quantum-computation-and-quantum-information/01E10196D0A682A6802309D06B22D27D) demonstrate in their quantum computing textbook, verifying balanced functions classically requires evaluating up to half the inputs plus one more in the worst case.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Quantum Speedup Context**: This classical implementation helps us understand why the [quantum version](https://quantum.country/qcvc) provides such dramatic improvement. Classical computers need up to 2^(n-1) + 1 function calls to distinguish constant from balanced functions (9 calls for 4 inputs), but quantum computers need just one oracle call regardless of input size. [Bernstein & Vazirani (1997)](https://epubs.siam.org/doi/10.1137/S0097539796300921) showed that this exponential separation between classical and quantum query complexity extends to many similar problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Function Objects and Abstraction**: The returned function object bundles lookup behavior with metadata about function type. This design pattern shows how Python's support for functions as first-class objects enables clean abstractions. [Abelson & Sussman (1996)](https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262510875/) explore these abstraction techniques extensively in *Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs*, showing how treating functions as data enables powerful programming techniques.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Mathematical Foundations**: The code directly implements the formal definitions from Boolean algebra. Constant functions satisfy f(x₁,x₂,x₃,x₄) = c for some fixed constant c, while balanced functions satisfy |{x: f(x) = True}| = 2^(n-1). These definitions come from [discrete mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boolean_function) and connect to [Rosen's (2019)](https://www.mheducation.com/highered/product/discrete-mathematics-applications-rosen/M9781259676512.html) treatment of Boolean functions in his discrete math textbook.\n",
    "\n",
    "This problem bridges abstract mathematical concepts with practical quantum algorithm development. It shows how classical computational limits drive the search for quantum solutions, connecting to the broader narrative of quantum computing research described by [Preskill (2018)](https://quantum-journal.org/papers/q-2018-08-06-79/) in his analysis of quantum computing in the current era."

    "\n",
    "**Question:** [Deutsch's algorithm](https://quantum.cloud.ibm.com/learning/en/courses/fundamentals-of-quantum-algorithms/quantum-query-algorithms/deutsch-algorithm) is designed to demonstrate a [potential advantage of quantum computing](https://www.quantamagazine.org/john-preskill-explains-quantum-supremacy-20191002/) over classical computation. To understand this advantage, we must first understand the classical cost of solving the underlying problem. Write a Python function ``determine_constant_balanced`` that takes as input a function ``f``, as defined in Problem 1. The function should analyze ``f`` and return the string ``\"constant\"`` or ``\"balanced\"`` depending on whether the function is constant or balanced. Write a brief note on the efficiency of your solution. What is the maximum number of times you need to call ``f`` to be 100% certain whether it is constant or balanced?"

    "\n",
    "The problem of determining whether a Boolean function is constant or balanced sits at the heart of understanding [quantum computational advantage](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-019-1666-5). Before we can appreciate what quantum computers offer, we need to understand how classical computers tackle this classification problem and why it proves fundamentally difficult for them.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Classical Decision Problem**\n",
    "\n",
    "Given a Boolean function with n inputs, we want to determine its type with absolute certainty. For our four-input functions from Problem 1, there are 2⁴ = 16 possible input combinations. A [constant function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constant_function) returns the same value for all 16 inputs, while a [balanced function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boolean_function) returns ``True`` for exactly 8 inputs and ``False`` for the other 8.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example of the Classical Approach:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Example: Testing if a function is constant or balanced\n",
    "def example_test(f):\n",
    "    first_output = f(False, False, False, False)\n",
    "    second_output = f(False, False, False, True)\n",
    "    \n",
    "    if first_output != second_output:\n",
    "        print(\"Function is balanced (different outputs found)\")\n",
    "    else:\n",
    "        print(\"Need more tests to be certain...\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# The problem: finding different outputs proves balanced,\n",
    "# but proving constant requires testing many inputs\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Worst-Case Analysis**\n",
    "\n",
    "The key insight is that proving a function is balanced requires finding two inputs that give different outputs, which could happen on the second function call. However, proving a function is constant requires confirming that every possible input returns the same value. In the [worst case](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Worst-case_complexity), a classical algorithm must evaluate the function at more than half of all possible inputs before it can be certain.\n",
    "\n",
    "For n Boolean inputs:\n",
    "- **Best case**: 2 function calls (find two different outputs immediately)\n",
    "- **Worst case**: 2^(n-1) + 1 function calls (check more than half the inputs)\n",
    "- **For 4 inputs**: Maximum of 9 function calls needed\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why This Matters**\n",
    "\n",
    "This problem illustrates a fundamental limitation of classical computation. As [Cleve et al. (1998)](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rspa.1998.0164) demonstrated, classical computers face an inherent lower bound on query complexity for this decision problem. No clever algorithm or optimization can reduce the worst-case number of queries below 2^(n-1) + 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "The [Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deutsch%E2%80%93Jozsa_algorithm) revolutionized our understanding by showing that a quantum computer can solve this same problem with just one function evaluation, regardless of the number of inputs. This represents an exponential speedup: as n grows, classical computers need exponentially more queries while quantum computers need exactly one.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Black-Box Model**\n",
    "\n",
    "This problem uses the [oracle model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oracle_machine) (also called black-box model), where we can only learn about the function by querying it with specific inputs. We cannot inspect its internal structure or implementation. This model allows fair comparison between classical and quantum algorithms since both receive the function as an opaque oracle. As [de Wolf (2019)](https://homepages.cwi.nl/~rdewolf/qcnotes.pdf) explains in his quantum computing lecture notes, query complexity provides a clean framework for demonstrating quantum advantages.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Connection to Problem 1**\n",
    "\n",
    "The functions generated in Problem 1 serve as perfect test cases for this classical testing algorithm. By constructing functions where we know the ground truth (constant or balanced), we can verify that our classical testing algorithm correctly identifies function types before comparing its performance to quantum approaches in later problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding this classical baseline is essential. The effort required to solve this problem classically makes the single-query quantum solution all the more remarkable, demonstrating that [quantum parallelism and interference](https://quantum.country/qcvc) can provide genuine computational advantages over classical approaches."

    "### Approach and Reasoning\n",
    "\n",
    "To determine whether a Boolean function is constant or balanced, I need to test it systematically until I can make a definitive conclusion. Here's my strategy:\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Basic Logic:**\n",
    "- If I find two inputs that produce different outputs, the function must be balanced\n",
    "- If all inputs I test produce the same output, it might be constant (but I need to test enough to be sure)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step-by-Step Approach:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Generate all possible inputs**: For a 4-input Boolean function, create all 16 possible combinations: (False, False, False, False), (False, False, False, True), etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Test inputs one by one**: Call the function with each input and record the output\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Look for differences**: As soon as I find two different outputs, I know it's balanced and can stop testing\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Handle the worst case**: If all outputs are the same, I need to test more than half the inputs to be certain it's constant\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why This Works:**\n",
    "- **For balanced functions**: I'll find different outputs quickly (within the first 9 tests at worst)\n",
    "- **For constant functions**: All outputs will be identical, and I need to test at least 9 inputs to be 100% certain\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Math Behind It:**\n",
    "With 4 inputs, there are 16 total combinations. A balanced function returns `True` for exactly 8 inputs and `False` for 8 inputs. In the worst case scenario, I might test all 8 inputs that return the same value before finding one that returns a different value. So I need at most 8 + 1 = 9 function calls to be completely certain.\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach is simple but effective - it's the best any classical computer can do for this problem. The [quantum version](https://www.ibm.com/quantum/blog/deutsch-jozsa-algorithm) can solve it with just one function call, which shows the power of quantum computing."
